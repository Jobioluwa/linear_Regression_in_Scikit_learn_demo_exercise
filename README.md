# Linear Regression in Scikit-Learn Demo Exercise

My first demonstration of linear regression using Python's scikit-learn library to predict house prices based on various features.

## Overview

This project uses linear regression to predict house prices from features such as:
- House size (square footage)
- Number of bedrooms
- Location factors
- Other relevant housing attributes

# Requirements
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib


# What This Demo Covers

1. **Data Overview** - Created a random housing dataset with Numpy
2. **Data Splitting** - Dividing into training and test sets
3. **Model Training** - Building a linear regression model
4. **Model Evaluation** - Assessing performance with MSE and R² scores
5. **Results Visualization** - Plotting actual vs predicted prices

## Usage

I ran the Jupyter notebook/Python script to see linear regression in action for house price prediction.

## Key Concepts

- Supervised learning
- Train-test split
- Model evaluation metrics (MSE, R²)
- Regression analysis
